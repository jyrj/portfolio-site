            <b>{occupation}</b> discovering the ways of code, helping others,
            exploring new horizons, and building communities. Fascinated by
            technology, I like to use my skills to solve problems, try new
            stuffs. If not working, unlearn things, try again is my way.
            Learning from mistakes is one of the important thing I learned from
            last 20 years, and that's what motivates me. Since my majority
            commits are mistakes, bugs don't make me depressed, yeah it feels
            sad sometimes though :/ Loves open source, help fixing bugs,
            soclialize (little), learn from others and likes to volunteer.
          </p>
          <p className="i-5">
            In my spare time, I would chill out with friends, talk about why
            Linux is better and yeah, if someone needs my time, help them out to
            learn or to fix bugs. Being from a calm village in the mid-Kerala, I
            love to spend time with nature, makes me feel refreshed. I have
            learned a lot about web development, machine learning, deep
            learning, backend development, hybrid cloud, at surface level, with
            aiming to make meaningful contributions to open source, that can
            make an impact.
