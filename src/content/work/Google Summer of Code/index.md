###### My Proposal for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5561974626189312" target="_blank">CalibrateSDR</a> has been accepted for Google Summer of Code under AerospaceResearch organization. The project revolves around digital signal processing, using Python and implementing the same for CalibrateSDR (GSM, NWS & LTE)</p>

* Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 10 week programming project during their break from school</p>

* Mentored by Andreas Hornig from <a href="https://AerospaceResearch.net" target="_blank">AerospaceResearch.net</a>. The project CalibrateSDR can have a wide impact on SDR Community, to accurately determine frequency offset using sync pulses of various signals</p>

* Coding period beigns from June 7, and will have a 2 stage evaluation, with final evaluation on August 31st. Smooth onboarding, thanks to the mentor, got email alias, blog access within the AerospaceResearch.net</p>

* Will be updating my blog weekly regarding my work</p>
